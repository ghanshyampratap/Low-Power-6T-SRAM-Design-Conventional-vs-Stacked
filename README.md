# 🧠 6T SRAM Cell – Conventional vs Stacked | LTspice Simulation (GPDK 90nm)

## 📘 INTRODUCTION
The 6T SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) cell is a fundamental building block in VLSI memory design, used for high-speed data storage. It consists of six transistors—four forming two cross-coupled inverters and two NMOS access transistors that interface with bitlines during read/write operations.

As CMOS size reduces, leakage power becomes a major concern. To reduce this leakage, **transistor stacking** techniques are introduced where additional series-connected transistors help lower subthreshold conduction.

### This project focuses on:
- Designing and simulating conventional and stacked 6T SRAM cells using LTspice  
- Analyzing read, write, and hold operations  
- Measuring and comparing average power consumption  
- Observing how stacking improves low-power performance

The conventional circuit uses six transistors to store a single bit.

The stacked design adds four additional NMOS transistors to reduce leakage.

## ⚙️ WORKING

### 🔧 Conventional 6T SRAM Cell
The cell consists of two CMOS inverters forming a bistable latch and two NMOS access transistors enabling connection to bitlines BL and BLB via the word-line WL.

#### Write Operation:
- WL = HIGH turns on access transistors  
- BL/BLB drive data into the cell  
- Stored state at Q and Q̅ flips accordingly  

#### Read Operation:
- WL = HIGH  
- Bitlines precharged  
- Stored data causes slight discharge on one bitline  

#### Hold Operation:
- WL = LOW  
- Cell isolated  
- Cross-coupled inverters retain data with minimal leakage

### 🔧 Stacked 6T SRAM Cell
The stacked version introduces two series-connected NMOS transistors in each pull-down path of the CMOS inverters.

#### Key Advantages:
- Reduced subthreshold leakage  
- Higher effective channel resistance  
- Better hold-mode power savings  

#### Write Operation:
Similar to conventional 6T SRAM but with slightly reduced speed due to increased resistance.

#### Read Operation:
Improved stability due to controlled discharge paths.

#### Hold Operation:
Leakage dramatically reduced due to transistor stacking effect.

## 🛠️ PROCEDURE

### 1️⃣ Circuit Design Setup
- Create two schematics: conventional and stacked 6T SRAM  
- Use ideal NMOS/PMOS transistor models  
- Apply VDD = 1.8V  
- Define BL, BLB, and WL sources  

### 2️⃣ Simulating Conventional 6T SRAM
- WL = HIGH for read/write  
- WL = LOW for hold  
- Perform transient analysis  
- Record power consumption and node voltages  

### 3️⃣ Simulating Stacked 6T SRAM
- Add series NMOS transistors in inverter pull-down paths  
- Run same transient test conditions  
- Compare switching behavior and average power

## 🔋 LOW POWER TECHNIQUE
The **transistor stacking effect** reduces leakage currents by:

- Increasing effective threshold voltage  
- Raising intermediate node voltage  
- Reducing Vgs and Vds  
- Minimizing subthreshold conduction paths  

Ideal for ultra-low-power memory applications.
